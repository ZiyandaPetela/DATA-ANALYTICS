# DATA-ANALYTICS
# INTRODUCTION 
Confident computer user?
A confident computer user is one who knows more than just the required key presses to operate the software they are using.
* The two most important qualities of a confident computer user are:
   * Knowing how to cope when things go wrong
   * Knowing how to learn new computing skills independently
* Personal computing is changing so fast and becoming so complex that it never gets a chance to settle down and become really reliable.
* There are various ways of coping with computing problems:
   * Save your work often – every few minutes, not every few hours.  
   *  Back up all your important work regularly – if you work on your computer all day this should be done daily. This means making copies of files somewhere else.
   * Look for workarounds.  There is usually more than one way of getting what you want to be done

* Learning New Computing Skills
There are several principles for learning new computing skills:
Learning different computer skills and how to use different computer programs is actually fairly easy.  There are numerous websites and YouTube videos to show how. Some of the principles for learning new computing skills are to try things out and explore. 
Do not be afraid to try things out and explore. You almost certainly will not do any harm by making mistakes – modern software will usually let you undo errors and will warn you before performing potentially damaging actions. 
Look for patterns. Find the differences and similarities between the ways in which things are done in different software, so you can begin to guess what to expect.
You will learn a lot by helping other people in addition to getting your own problems solved by them. During this program, you will be able to develop your support network further by using the Internet. E-mail, chat, and the Web all greatly increase the ways in which you can seek help and information and, of course, help others.
# Data Analytics
Analytics is at the heart of modern business. Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings. Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.
The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. This involves several key responsibilities and skills.

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analysis:

Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.
3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:

Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.
4. Decision Support:

Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.
5. Collaboration and Communication:
Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,
6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.


# World of Analytics
*  three major pillars that have come together at this moment to allow analytics programs to thrive: data, storage, and computing power.
*  Data -From the organized tables of spreadsheets to the storage of photos, video, and audio recordings, modern businesses create an almost overwhelming avalanche of data that is ripe for use in analytics programs.
*  Storage - The second key trend driving the growth of analytics programs is the increased availability of storage at rapidly decreasing costs.
*  Computing Power

# The Analytics Process
* Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data
* Data Acquisition
* Cleaning and Manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and Communication
# The Analytics Process is Iterative
* The steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
* This process is meant to help you understand the different activities that take place during a data analysis effort and the approximate order in which they typically occur.

# Analytics Techniques
* Descriptive Analytics
* Predictive Analytics
* Predictive Analytics
 # Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
 * Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
 * Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
 * Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
 * Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way.

# Data Governance

* Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.
# Analytics Tools
* Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process.
*  These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.
*  They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.
# Understanding Data
# Exploring Data Types
* To understand data types, it is best first to understand data elements. A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values.
* Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events.
*  A data type limits the values a data element can have.
*  Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic.
*  Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic.
*  Spreadsheets, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers, are practical tools for representing tabular data.
*   A relational database management system (RDMS), commonly called a database, extends the tabular model. Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables.

# Structured Data Types
* Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns.
* Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand.
*  In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.
# Character
* The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters.
* Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. *Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.
* alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters.

# Character Sets
* Numeric - When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute, numeric becomes the data type of choice. 
* Whole Numbers - The integer, and all its subtypes, are for storing whole numbers. 
* Rational Numbers - the numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point. 
* Date and Time - road category of date, day of year and time of day are data elements that appear with great frequency.
* Currency -financial data is numeric, people prefer seeing the numbers displayed as a specific currency. For example, consider the Number, Dollar, and Euro

# Strong And Weak Typing
* Strong typing is when technology rigidly enforces data types.
* Weak typing loosely enforces data types. Spreadsheets use weak typing to help make it easier for people to accomplish their work.
* Software that uses weak typing can be helpful.
  
# Unstructured Data Types
* Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model.
* Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses.
*  Analyzing unstructured data creates a wealth of information and insight.
*  unstructured data type :
*  Binary
*  Audio
*  Images
*  Video
*  Large Text
# Categories of Data
* Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data - Quantitative data consists of numeric values. Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are quantitative.Qualitative data consists of frequent text values. Data elements whose values describe characteristics, traits, and attitudes are all qualitative. 
* Discrete vs. Continuous Data - discrete data is that it represents measurements that can't be subdivided. You may intuitively think of discrete data as using whole numbers, but that doesn't have to be the case. when you measure things like height and weight, you are collecting continuous data. While whole numbers represent discrete data, continuous data typically need a decimal point. 
* Categorical Data - numeric data, there is categorical data. Text data with a known, finite number of categories is categorical.
* Dimensional Data - Dimensional modeling organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables store measurement data that is of interest to a business.

# Common Data Structures
* Structured Data - Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent, defined manner, organized into columns and rows.
* Unstructured data is qualitative, describing the characteristics of an event or an object. Images, phrases, audio or video recordings, and descriptive text are all examples of unstructured data. There is very little that is common about different kinds of unstructured data.
* Machine data is a common source of unstructured data. Machine data has various sources, including Internet of Things devices, smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and servers.
* Semi-structured data is data that has structure and that is not tabular. Email is a well-known example of semi-structured data.

# Common File Formats
* Common file formats facilitate data exchange and tool interoperability.
* Text files are one of the most commonly used data file formats. As the name implies, they consist of plain text and are limited in scope to alphanumeric data.
*  One of the reasons text files are so widely adopted is their ability to be opened regardless of platform or operating system without needing a proprietary piece of software.
*  Whether you are using a Microsoft Windows desktop, an Apple MacBook, or a Linux server, you can easily open a text file. Text files are also commonly referred to as flat files.
*  Fixed-Width Files - are more laborious to create since they require a few extra steps.
*  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open standard file format, designed to add structure to a text file without incurring significant overhead.
*   One of its design principles is that JSON is easily readable by people and easily parsed by modern programming languages.
*    Languages such as Python, R, and Go have libraries containing functions that facilitate reading and writing JSON files.
*   extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that facilitates structuring data in a text file.
*  While conceptually similar to JSON, XML incurs more overhead because it makes extensive use of tags. Tags describe a data element and enclose each value for each data element.
* While these tags help readability, they add a significant amount of overhead.
* HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
*  HTML pages serve as the foundation for how people interact with the World Wide Web. Similar to XML, HTML is a tag-based language.

# CHAPTER THREE - Databases and Data Acquisition
* two categories categories of a database 1.Relational 2.Nonrelational
* Relational databases excel at storing and processing structured data.
* The need to interact with unstructured data is one of the reasons behind the rise of nonrelational databases.
