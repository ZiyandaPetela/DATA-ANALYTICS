# DATA-ANALYTICS
# INTRODUCTION 
Confident computer user?
A confident computer user is one who knows more than just the required key presses to operate the software they are using.
* The two most important qualities of a confident computer user are:
   * Knowing how to cope when things go wrong
   * Knowing how to learn new computing skills independently
* Personal computing is changing so fast and becoming so complex that it never gets a chance to settle down and become really reliable.
* There are various ways of coping with computing problems:
   * Save your work often – every few minutes, not every few hours.  
   *  Back up all your important work regularly – if you work on your computer all day this should be done daily. This means making copies of files somewhere else.
   * Look for workarounds.  There is usually more than one way of getting what you want to be done

* Learning New Computing Skills
There are several principles for learning new computing skills:
Learning different computer skills and how to use different computer programs is actually fairly easy.  There are numerous websites and YouTube videos to show how. Some of the principles for learning new computing skills are to try things out and explore. 
Do not be afraid to try things out and explore. You almost certainly will not do any harm by making mistakes – modern software will usually let you undo errors and will warn you before performing potentially damaging actions. 
Look for patterns. Find the differences and similarities between the ways in which things are done in different software, so you can begin to guess what to expect.
You will learn a lot by helping other people in addition to getting your own problems solved by them. During this program, you will be able to develop your support network further by using the Internet. E-mail, chat, and the Web all greatly increase the ways in which you can seek help and information and, of course, help others.
# Data Analytics
Analytics is at the heart of modern business. Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings. Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.
The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. This involves several key responsibilities and skills.

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analysis:

Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.
3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:

Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.
4. Decision Support:

Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.
5. Collaboration and Communication:
Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,
6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.


# World of Analytics
*  three major pillars that have come together at this moment to allow analytics programs to thrive: data, storage, and computing power.
*  Data -From the organized tables of spreadsheets to the storage of photos, video, and audio recordings, modern businesses create an almost overwhelming avalanche of data that is ripe for use in analytics programs.
*  Storage - The second key trend driving the growth of analytics programs is the increased availability of storage at rapidly decreasing costs.
*  Computing Power

# The Analytics Process
* Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data
* Data Acquisition
* Cleaning and Manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization
* Reporting and Communication
# The Analytics Process is Iterative
* The steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
* This process is meant to help you understand the different activities that take place during a data analysis effort and the approximate order in which they typically occur.

# Analytics Techniques
* Descriptive Analytics
* Predictive Analytics
* Predictive Analytics
 # Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
 * Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
 * Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
 * Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
 * Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way.

# Data Governance

* Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.
# Analytics Tools
* Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process.
*  These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.
*  They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.
# Understanding Data
# Exploring Data Types
* To understand data types, it is best first to understand data elements. A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values.
* Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events.
*  A data type limits the values a data element can have.
*  Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic.
*  Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic.
*  Spreadsheets, including Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and Apple Numbers, are practical tools for representing tabular data.
*   A relational database management system (RDMS), commonly called a database, extends the tabular model. Instead of having all data in a single table, a database organizes related data across multiple tables.

# Structured Data Types
* Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns.
* Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand.
*  In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.
# Character
* The character data type limits data entry to only valid characters.
* Characters can include the alphabet that you might see on your keyboard, as well as numbers. *Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.
* alphanumeric is the most widely used data type for storing character-based data. As the name implies, alphanumeric is appropriate when a data element consists of both numbers and letters.

# Character Sets
* Numeric - When numbers exclusively make up values for a data attribute, numeric becomes the data type of choice. 
* Whole Numbers - The integer, and all its subtypes, are for storing whole numbers. 
* Rational Numbers - the numeric data type is for rational numbers that include a decimal point. 
* Date and Time - road category of date, day of year and time of day are data elements that appear with great frequency.
* Currency -financial data is numeric, people prefer seeing the numbers displayed as a specific currency. For example, consider the Number, Dollar, and Euro
